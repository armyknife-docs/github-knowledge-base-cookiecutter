# Creating Content

This guide explains how to create and format content for your knowledge base.

## Markdown Basics

Content is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language:

- Use `#` for headings
- Use `*` or `-` for bullet points
- Use `1.` for numbered lists
- Use `**text**` for bold text
- Use `*text*` for italic text

## File Organization

Organize your files in a logical directory structure under the `docs` folder. This structure will be reflected in your site's URL paths.
